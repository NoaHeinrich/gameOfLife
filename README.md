# gameOfLife
Back-end coding challenge

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life coded in Ruby. Given a height and a width, it will generate a randomized grid of cells. An X represents a live cell, and an O represents a dead cell.

To run the simulation, type "ruby runner.rb" on the command line. Then simply follow the prompts.

To run RSpec tests, type "rspec ." from the command line.
